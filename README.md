# Hedgehog Scraper

This is a starter kit for the [Hedgehog Web Scraper Workshop](https://github.com/ameseee/web-scraper-workshop).

## Set Up 
- Click "Fork" in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the project, but in your GitHub account.
- In your project, click the green "Clone or Download" button. Then, click the clipboard icon.
- Back in your terminal, type "control", "alt", and "t" at the same time. A new window should open. 
- Type `cd ..`. In this new window, follow this next set of directions.
- Type `git clone ` and "control v". You should see something like: `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/hedgehog-scraper.git`. Press enter.
- Type `cd hedgehog-scraper`
- Type `npm install`
- Type `npm start`
- You should see something like this in your terminal:
```bash
  > a-hedgie-scraper@1.0.0 start /Users/amyholt/personal_projects/a-hedgie-scraper
  > node server.js

  app running on 3000
```
- Open a new window in the broswer. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see a very small "Hedgehog Time" in the top left corner of the screen. You are ready to go!
- Keep your terminal open at all times!
